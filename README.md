# Flashcards

Flashcards is a quiz builder app that was made using Redux/Redux Toolkit, React, HTML, javascript and CSS.
It allows the user to create quizzes and topics which they can be assigned to. The components and their 
functions were built by me but the folder was initially porvided by code academy. 

The app is currently not fully functional.
